# MarsRover code challenge

The logic for the system is written and tested in C#, and the UI is implemented in Unity.

I'd you just like to open the logic and it's tests independently of Unity, open the DomainOnly.sln.

I also decided to add a simulation step system, where you can see the result of each step rather than just the output.
